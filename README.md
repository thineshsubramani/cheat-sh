## Vibe Coded my quick cheat sheet 

I turned my extra monitor into a simple cheat sheet because I'm tired of switching tabs for the same info. Now, everything I usually forget is right in my peripheral vision so I never have to stop what I'm doing. It keeps my workflow fast and makes my desk setup look like a high-tech command center. It is basically a "brain backup" that stays open so I can just glance and keep moving.
